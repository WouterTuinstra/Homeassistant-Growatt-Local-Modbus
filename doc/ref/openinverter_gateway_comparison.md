# OpenInverterGateway TL-XH register comparison

This report is generated by ``compare_openinverter_gateway.py`` and compares the TL-XH register metadata bundled with the OpenInverterGateway project against the Home Assistant register specification.

## Summary

* Found 21 register(s) where the two sources disagree on units, scaling, or signedness.
* OpenInverterGateway defines 36 input register(s) that are absent from the Home Assistant spec.
* OpenInverterGateway includes 1 holding register(s) that are not documented in the spec.
* The Home Assistant spec still lists 3 TL-XH telemetry register(s) (3000–3184) missing from OpenInverterGateway and 36 additional BMS address(es) in the 3185–3249 block.
* OpenInverterGateway defines multiple names for input register(s) 3000, 3166.

## Registers missing from OpenInverterGateway

### TL-XH telemetry block (3000–3184)

| Address | Name |
| --- | --- |
| 3110 | Warning code |
| 3111 | Present FFT value (channel A) |
| 3164 | BDC presence flag |

### BMS / battery detail block (3185–3249)

OpenInverterGateway stops at register 3184 and omits the downstream BMS telemetry block present in the Home Assistant spec.

*Home Assistant covers 36 addresses in this range; see the main spec for details.*
