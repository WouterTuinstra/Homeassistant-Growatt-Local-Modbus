# Modbus Simulator Register Read Debugging Report & ToDo List

## Findings

1. **Test Setup:**
   - The Modbus simulator is started once per test session using a pytest fixture.
   - Register read tests use pymodbus to read individual and block ranges from the simulator.

2. **Observed Behavior:**
   - Communication with the simulator works for some registers, but fails for others (e.g., address 2 returns 100 instead of expected 0).
   - After a mismatch or certain reads, pymodbus reports "No response received after 3 retries" and the connection is lost.
   - Simulator logs show register reads and server shutdown, but do not indicate clear errors.

3. **Possible Causes:**
   - Dataset or simulator initialization may be setting unexpected values for some registers.
   - Addressing (0-based vs 1-based) may be inconsistent between client and simulator.
   - The simulator may not handle all register requests correctly, or may close the connection on error.
   - There may be off-by-one errors or bounds issues in the simulator's value array logic.

4. **Current Debugging Steps:**
   - Logging enabled for all register reads/writes (`debug_wire=True`).
   - Test logs each address and value before assertion.
   - Simulator and client use unit ID 1 and compatible framer.

## ToDo List for Agent

1. **Add Detailed Logging:**
   - Log every register read in both the test and simulator, including address, count, and returned value.
   - Log any exceptions or connection loss events in the simulator.

2. **Verify Register Initialization:**
   - Print the initial values of all registers in the simulator after dataset loading.
   - Confirm that all registers are zero-initialized except those set by the dataset.

3. **Check Address Handling:**
   - Ensure both client and simulator use 0-based addressing for register reads.
   - Validate that requested addresses are within bounds and handled correctly.

4. **Isolate Problematic Reads:**
   - Run a minimal test that reads only the problematic address (e.g., address 2) and log the result.
   - Test block reads and individual reads for a small range to compare behavior.

5. **Compare Dataset and Simulator State:**
   - Print expected values from the dataset and actual values from the simulator for all tested addresses.
   - Investigate any mismatches and trace their source.

6. **Review Simulator Response Logic:**
   - Inspect `LoggingDataBlock.getValues` and related code to ensure all requests are handled and return a value.
   - Ensure the simulator does not close the connection or raise exceptions on out-of-bounds or missing registers.

7. **Document and Fix Issues:**
   - Summarize findings and propose fixes for any discovered bugs (e.g., off-by-one errors, dataset loading issues, connection handling).
   - Implement and test fixes, then update the report.

**Instructions for Agent:**
- Work through the ToDo list step by step.
- Document findings and changes in this file.
- Ensure all register reads succeed and values match expectations.
- Leave detailed logs and comments for future debugging.
